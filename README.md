# development is starting to pick up again

# scamsblocklist

this just blocks scams i update this everytime i find one

you can send requests in issues if a scam website isn't blocked

ublock is recommended for filters as it actually stops you from going to the website and ublacklist lets you go to the website if you go to it directly

if you are using ublacklist you can click [this](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/subscribe?name=Scams+Blocklist&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixelyloaf/scamsblocklist/refs/heads/main/ublacklist.txt) (only works on chromium browsers)

~~ublock one is done manually~~

~~1. click ublock and enter the dashboard~~
~~2. go to filter lists~~
~~3. click import and paste this into the url box https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixelyloaf/scamsblocklist/refs/heads/main/ublock.txt~~

   ~~this might not work i haven't tested it yet i should though~~

automatic setup for ublock works now, click [here](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fpixelyloaf%2Fscamsblocklist%2Fmaster%2Fublock.txt&title=Scams%20Blocklist) or right click [this](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fpixelyloaf%2Fscamsblocklist%2Fmaster%2Fublock.txt&title=Scams%20Blocklist) and add it to your filter list (you can right click the here one aswell i just added the right click version because i felt like it)
for hide use [this](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fpixelyloaf%2Fscamsblocklist%2Fmaster%2Fublockhide.txt&title=Scams%20Blocklist%20Hide) or right click [this](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fpixelyloaf%2Fscamsblocklist%2Fmaster%2Fublockhide.txt&title=Scams%20Blocklist%20Hide)
