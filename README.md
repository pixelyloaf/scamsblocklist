# scamsblocklist

this just blocks scams i update this everytime i find one

you can send requests in issues if a scam website isn't blocked

ublock is recommended for filters as it actually stops you from going to the website and ublacklist lets you go to the website if you go to it directly

if you are using ublacklist you can click [this](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/subscribe?name=Scams+Blocklist&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixelyloaf/scamsblocklist/refs/heads/main/ublacklist.txt)

ublock one is done manually

1. click ublock and enter the dashboard
2. go to filter lists
3. click import and paste this into the url box https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixelyloaf/scamsblocklist/refs/heads/main/ublock.txt

   this might not work i haven't tested it yet i should though
